PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This File Accessing and Monitoring System (FAMS) provides secure and efficient file management with integrated authentication mechanisms. It allows users to perform operations like file upload, download, deletion, and sharing, while enforcing security through email and phone number verification during registration. The system ensures that only verified users can access their files, stored securely in the database based on the current user login.
This system provides a comprehensive solution to secure file access, minimizing security risks while ensuring user privacy and data protection.

FEATURES:

User Authentication: Email verification and OTP-based phone number verification at registration.

 File Operations: Users can upload, download, delete, and share files securely.
 
 User Reauthentication: For sensitive operations like file deletion, users must reauthenticate via password.
 
 Admin Access: Admins can access all files, protected by biometric authentication to enhance security.
 
 File Segregation: Files are stored separately based on the logged-in user to prevent unauthorized access.
 
 Enhanced Security: Protects files from hacking attempts, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Firebase authentication, database, cloud storage and Android studio(kotlin).
